# libRecurrence, a library for parsing human descriptions of time

This library implements a parser to recognize time specifications in plain
language that describe when events occur. Currently, only English is supported.
For example, the library can be used to parse the following sentences:

    "The first of the month"
    "Every third Wednesday"
    "Weekly on Saturday"

...And so forth.
